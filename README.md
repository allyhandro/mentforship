# Mentorship Concepts
The Mentforship framework of technical Mentorship operates under the assumption that we can all teach and learn from one another, no matter what our seniority. Participants are allowed to participate as mentees and mentors non-exclusively to encourage development of Mentoring skills earlier in the career.

## Step 1: Intake
Participants fill out a form indicating what they would like their **focus** to be for the round of Mentorship. ([example form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebKhW5bGSWGeQe84dIS3OlagNi3XRysBW6wq3eEP8mQl2eiA/viewform?usp=send_form)) 

Focuses are split into **skills**, the hard technical skills used to work in tech, and **practices**, the soft skills and concepts behind workflow, architechture, etc. Participant pairings with a **skill focus** are encouraged to create a small working project or POC together. Participant pairings with a **practice focus** are encouraged to meet frequently to allow for thorough exploration of the topic via conversation. 

## Step 2: Matching
Matching takes place between two *non-exclusive* sets of participants, Mentors and Mentees. 
Mentors can have 0 to selected Preference Matches per round.
Mentees should ideally have at least 1 match per round.
